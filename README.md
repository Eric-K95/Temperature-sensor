# Temperature-sensor
Thermistor Sensor Module is used to detect temperature and convert it into output signals. Thermistors are variable resistors that change their resistance with temperature. They are classified by the way their resistance responds to temperature changes. In this exercise, Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors, resistance decreases with an increase in temperature, will be used. The Steinhart-Hart equation will be applied to convert the resistance of the thermistor to a temperature.
